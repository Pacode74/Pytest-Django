Object of the project: To build Django app (Corona vs tech) that includes writing End-to-End (E2E) Pytest Suit for it. We are going to have a complete Continuous Integration System that is going to run our tests each time that we make a push to multiple repositories. It will show the status Fail is one of our tests failed. The emphases in the project goes mainly to pytesting. 

Corona vs tech application will be able to list which companies are hiring, firing or hiring freeze in Corona time. 

Firstly, build simple Django app using deployment platform Heroku. Django app is going to be an end to end application. But, we're going to build only the backend for the server. The front-end will be provided by Django. 

So if we take a look at this application, we can see that we have a list of companies. And we can see for each company whether it's hiring, if it has layoffs or it's in a hiring freeze. Now, we can see when this was last updated and for a company which is hiring, we can go and see its application page.

Use Django admin panel to add, delete, and update our companies. There is also an email sending mechanism that is sending an email to the the email we configured before.
